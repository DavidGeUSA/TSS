//this task file is for executing task 3
//this task runs a speed comparison between using class RadiusIndexToSeriesIndex and using a row-major 3D array looping; it requires a command line parameter "/W"; it requires a task parameter "FDTD.N"
//
//a space point (x,y,z) is represented by 3 integers m,n, and p, x=m*ds, y=n*ds, z=p*ds
//m,n,p=0,+-1,+-2,...,+-maxRadius
//r=max(|m|,|n|,|p|) is called a radius
//
//EM field at 3D space points are saved in a 1D memory, block by block; 
//each block consists of space points on the same radius; smaller radiuses go first. 
//
//class RadiusIndexToSeriesIndex keeps a 3D array of integers forming a mapping of (m,n,p) to integer;
//the integer is the index into the whole 1D memory. 
//It provides an efficient way of accessing field memory given (m,n,p)
//
//this task examines the efficiency of class RadiusIndexToSeriesIndex, 
//by examining how much slower than a row-major 3D array looping

//task number
SIM.TASK=3

//half number of grids, maxRadius=2N+1
FDTD.N=150
